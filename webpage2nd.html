            The words on Zeno Zoldyk’s clothing say either “A Kill A Day” (一日一殺) or “Never Retire” (生涯現役)   <br>
            The Phantom Troupe has an arm wrestling rank among themselves to determine their physical strength.
          <br> The order from strongest to weakest of this arm wrestling is Uvogin, Phinks, Hisoka, Franklin, Feitan, Machi, Chrollo, Bonolenov, Nobunaga, Shalnark, Pakunoda, Shizuku, and Kortopi.  <br>
            All four main protagonists share the same birthday characteristics – having the same number of birth month and day  <br>
              And coincidentally, Hisoka too shares the same birthday characteristic. This is the reason why some fans consider him as the fifth protagonist.<br>
             Sui Ishida, the creator of Tokyo Ghoul, is a big fan of “Hunter X Hunter”.</p>  <br>
